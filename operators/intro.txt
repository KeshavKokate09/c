Operators

There are Three types of operators in C, Unary, Binary and Ternary
Unary : When there is only one oprand in the expression then this is calle das Unary operator. 
	1.Unary Operator has mainly two operators such as "pre" and "post".
	2.Unary Operators (++, --)
	3. ++ Increament = PreIncrement (++var) and PostIncrement (var++)
	4. -- Decreament = PreDecrement (--var) and PostDecrement (var--)
	5.using same multiple unary operations on same line using single or the same variable is bad practice of programming

Binary : when There are two oerands in the expression then this type of expression are called as binary Operators.
	1. Binary operators subdivided into 
		a. Arithmetic : it contains (+,-,*,/,%)
		b. Logical : it contains (&& and ||) 
			1. 0 means false
			2. other than all numbers are true;
		c. relational : it contains (<=,<,>,>=,==,!=)
		d. bitwise : it contains (<<,>>,&,|,xor)
		e. Assignment : it contains (=, +=, -=, *=,/=)
Ternery : When there are 3 oprands in a expression then this type of ex[ression is called as ternery operator.
